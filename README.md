# Book-Tracker
 Our application will be a book tracking interface that allows users to track their own reading progress with insightful statistics, share book reviews with an online community, and explore a collection of books to find their next read. The user will have a personalized bookshelf where they can store their past reads and a profile page that displays personal information.
